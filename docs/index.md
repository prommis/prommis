About PrOMMiS
-------------

PrOMMiS (Process Optimization and Modeling for Minerals Sustainability) is a multi-institutional
collaboration building a software modeling platform to accelerate development and deployment of
extraction and purification processes for critical minerals and rare earth elements at reduced risk.

PrOMMiS helps to guarantee national strategic objectives for critical materials:

* Secure supply chains
* Economic competitiveness
* Energy security and independence

PrOMMiS leverages tools and models from the Institute for Design of Advanced Energy Systems
([IDAES](https://idaes.org/)), Carbon Capture Simulation for Industry Impact
([CCSI2](https://www.acceleratecarboncapture.org/)) and other related programs.
