    "# __Byproduct Recovery Framework Tutorial__\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the __byproduct recovery decision framework__ (hereafter referenced to as _the framework_), which is defined in ``determine_byproduct_recovery.py``.The framework assesses the economic viability of converting waste streams into saleable byproducts based on a known viability criterion. This framework serves as a decision-support tool for determining whether specific byproducts should be recovered. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial gives an example of how to use the framework to determine if lithium and cobalt should be recovered from a diafiltration process. This framework can be generalized to other recoverable byproducts if appropriate pricing data is provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate byproduct recovery, annualized net benefit is assessed with the following equations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{net\\_benefit} = \\text{potential\\_revenue} - \\text{total\\_recovery\\_cost}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{potential\\_revenue} = \\sum_{m} \\left( \n",
    "\\text{material\\_production}_{m} \\cdot \\text{market\\_value}_{m} + \n",
    "\\text{avoided\\_waste\\_disposal\\_cost}_{m} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{total\\_recovery\\_cost} = \\sum_{m} \\left( \n",
    "\\text{conversion\\_cost}_{m} \\cdot \\text{conversion\\_possible}_{m} + \n",
    "\\text{added\\_process\\_cost}_{m} \\cdot \\text{added\\_process\\_steps}_{m} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions of Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `material_productionₘ`: Mass flow rate of recovered byproduct *m* (kg/yr).\n",
    "- `market_valueₘ`: Market price of byproduct *m* (USD/kg).\n",
    "- `avoided_waste_disposal_costₘ`: Avoided disposal cost for byproduct *m* (USD/kg).\n",
    "- `conversion_costₘ`: Annualized cost (considering both CAPEX and OPEX) of the recovery process for byproduct *m* (USD/yr).\n",
    "- `conversion_possibleₘ`: Binary indicator for whether conversion is required for byproduct *m* (1 = required, 0 = not required).\n",
    "- `added_process_costₘ`: Annualized cost (considering both CAPEX and OPEX) of additional process units for recovering byproduct *m* (USD/yr).\n",
    "- `added_process_stepsₘ`: Binary indicator for whether addiitonal process units are required for recovering byproduct *m* (1 = required, 0 not required).\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the byproduct recovery framework effectively, a byproduct recovery process with costing must already be constructed. To learn the basics of the REE Costing Framework, please refer to [Part 1 of the REE Costing Tutorial](ree_costing_framework_basic_features-solution.ipynb). This is necessary to determine the __annualized cost__ and __annual revenue__ associated with recovery. Once the process model is built, users can import it—along with its corresponding cost and revenue—and apply the byproduct recovery framework to decide whether or not the byproduct should be recovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Learning Objectives__: By the end of this tutorial, users will be able to:\n",
    "- Decide and import the necessary Python packages\n",
    "- Build a process flowsheet using a case study: __lithium-cobalt recovery via diafiltration__\n",
    "- Apply the __byproduct recovery decision framework__"

    "## __Step 2: Building on the Pre-defined Diafiltration Process__\n",
    "\n",
    "This section gives a brief introduction of how to build upon the pre-defined diafiltration process model. The lithium-cobalt diafiltration process is implemented in the file [diafiltration.py](https://github.com/prommis/prommis/blob/main/src/prommis/nanofiltration/diafiltration.py), available in the PrOMMiS repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "To construct a process flowsheet using this existing model, users can refer to the detailed walkthrough provided in the [Multi_Stream Contactor Tutorial (Solution)](https://github.com/prommis/prommis/blob/main/docs/tutorials/diafiltration-solution.ipynb). This tutorial outlines major order for building the flowsheet. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether lithium and cobalt should be recovered, the user first needs to __build the diafiltration process__ and __access the cost and revenue__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer the process model defined in ``diafiltration.py``. Specifically, call the functions in the order specified within the ``main()`` function. Following this order is crucial because the diafiltration process consists of three membrane stages, and the model is built stage by stage. \n",
    "\n",
    "During each stage of model building, initialization is performed with a set of variables fixed. When transitioning to the next stage, previously fixed variables must be unfixed, and new variables need to be fixed for the current stage. This sequential initialization ensures that the model is stable and properly configured at each membrane stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The production rates of lithium and cobalt from the diafiltration process are expressed in kilograms per hour (kg/hr). Assuming the plant operates 8,000 hours annually, the annual production of lithium and cobalt can be calculated by multiplying the hourly production rates by 8,000 hr/yr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code may generate warnings related to volumetric flow being temporarily set to zero during initialization—values that fall outside the predefined variable bounds. These warnings do not affect model performance and can be safely ignored."
