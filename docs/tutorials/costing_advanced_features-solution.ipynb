    "# 2 Build Process Model Flowsheet\n",
    "\n",
    "The REE Costing Framework supports integration with costing methods imported from [WaterTAP](https://watertap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), an external package for modeling water treatment operations such as aqueous membrane processes involving REE components. Cost accounts imported from the built-in dictionary may be attached to either unit model blocks or generic `UnitModelBlock` objects. In contrast, WaterTAP costing methods look for the unit model class, i.e. to import costing for a WaterTAP model the flowsheet needs to contain that WaterTAP model before calling `build_process_costs`. The costing framework handles passing unit model references, importing costing methods, and extracting the necessary capital and operating cost components. On the flowsheet side, users only need to define their unit models and pass them to the costing method.\n",

    "## 2.1 Build Flowsheet\n",

    "For this example, we will build a flowsheet containing a WaterTAP unit model. We'll see that the `build_process_costs` method will automatically extract the relevant costing objects.\n",

    "There are a few important details in the model above. First, the decorator `@declare_process_block_class()` tells the Python interpreter to register the new class as an importable object with the name \"CustomCosting\". The class inherits all properties of the `FlowsheetCostingBlock` class by calling its corresponding data class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line inside the custom class defines a new cost unit `USD_custom` with a Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) value of 700. `USD_CE500` is a reference unit container enabling conversion between currency units. The method `build_global_params` defines the base cost year and period for the model. Since the class inherits all properties of the `FlowsheetCostingBlockData` class, the final model will return cost variables in units of `USD_2021` and any time units will be `year` or `a` (annum, the two are equivalent in Pyomo unit container syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the method `cost_custom_vessel` defines all cost equations. Each of the three cost variables (capital, fixed operating, variable operating) is built by defining a cost per unit with appropriate inputs, and then a total cost based on the number of units. The naming convention is important, since the REE Costing Framework will look for variables named `capital_cost`, `fixed_operating_cost`, and `variable_operating_cost` when building the process cost equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, note that the currency units are set as `costing_package.base_currency` everywhere in the custom model. The object `costing_package` is the main flowsheet costing class set by the user, so the model will automatically use those default cost units. The examples below will demonstrate this further."

    "Now, let's use the costing framework to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the process. The NPV represents the total value of the plant construction, operation, and production over the plant lifetime taking into account the changing worth of money over time. For example, distributed capital costs over multiple years or operating costs per year over the entire lifetime of a plant may grow with an escalation or inflation rate. The NPV provides a way to normalize costs over time to the current dollar year. Typical NPV components include capital cost, operating cost, revenue (this is a positive contribution, although we don't have one in the current example), and cash flows from capital loan repayment.\n",
    "\n",

Users may provide their own values instead to bypass this requirement (see Section 4.1) or link to the costing framework (see Section 4.2). Additionally, the framework supports tax calculations from process revenue and costs (see Section 4.3)."

    "## 4.3 Tax and Incentives Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we know some information about the taxes and production incentives associated with constructing and operating this plant. We can define these properties, and the net present value method will automatically pick up these cash flows if present in the model. Users may include tax and incentives calculations by passing the following arguments to the `build_process_costs` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `consider_taxes`: True/False flag for calculating net tax owed. Defaults to False.\n",
    "* `income_tax_percentage`: combined federal and state income tax percentage, usually between 26 - 40%. Here, it defaults to 26%.\n",
    "* `mineral_depletion_percentage`: fixed tax deduction percentage for mineral depletion based on the type of mineral recovered, defaults to 14% of gross income excluding royalties as reported in the UKy report.\n",
    "* `production_incentive_percentage`: tax deduction percentage for producing critical minerals, defaults to 10% of total production cost (excludes cost of feedstock).\n",
    "* `royalty_charge_percentage_of_revenue`: Percentage of revenue charged as royalties; defaults to 6.5% as reported in the UKy report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Income tax is a negative cash flow and is a percentage of the total net sales revenue (total gross sales revenue minus total annual production cost). Similarly, royalties are a negative cash flow and are a fixed percentage of the total gross sales revenue. Income tax is typically set by local laws applying to the construction site, whereas royalties are charged by the land owner. The default charge rates are 26% income tax, per NETL QGESS guidelines, and 6.5% royalties, per the [University of Kentucky report](https://doi.org/10.2172/1569277).\n",
    "\n",
    "Production incentives are a positive cash flow offsetting income tax based on the total annual production cost. Similarly, mineral depletion is a positive cash flow offsetting income tax based on total gross revenue excluding royalties. Production incentives are typically offered by governmental agencies to encourage production of certain material goods, whereas the mineral depletion charges allows plant operators to recover a portion of the expense associated with the reduced site value from extracting materials. The default rates are 10% production incentives, per the 45X mineral production credit, and 14% mineral depletion, per the [University of Kentucky report](https://doi.org/10.2172/1569277).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the net present value method will create and solve for a variable `pv_taxes` for the present value of taxes projected over the plant lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The University of Kentucky report and case study are discussed further in the [UKy Flowsheet](uky_flowsheet-solution.ipynb) tutorial and with costing in the [UKy Flowsheet with Costing](costing_uky_flowsheet-solution.ipynb) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "As our current scenario involves brine nanofiltration and not mineral processing, the mineral depletion rate does not apply and is set to zero; however, the process still qualifies for a production incentive and this term is thus included.\n",

    "The costing framework supports calculation of process cost savings using economy of numbers, which estimates future profitability of novel equipment and cost savings due to experiential learning. Let's suppose that our brine nanofiltration process becomes more efficient over time as the technology develops; we want to see how much the cost reduces due to knowledge gain over time.\n",

    "\n",
    "The cost of manufacturing a piece of equipment tends to decline as the production quantity increases (economy of scales), but also as new generations of that equipment are developed leading to increases in technical knowledge (economy of numbers). New equipment are often denoted as First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) equipment while later generations with improved knowledge are denoted as Nth-of-a-Kind (NOAK) equipment.\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the costing framework supports calculating costing bounds based on the feedstock capacity and grade of a process. This method applies to various types of mineral processing, not brine nanofiltration; as such, a toy example will be used here rather than the brine nanofiltration process\n",

    "Like the fixed input NPV method in section 4 and the economy of numbers method in Section 5, the costing bounding method is independent of the main costing framework.

Nat Sustain 6, 1103–1112 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41893-023-01145-1. The study establishes a database of capital and operating expenses for REE recovery and market prices of saleable mineral products, and develops surrogates models to predict the maximum cost threshold of specific process types to determine the economic viability. Thresholds are calculated using a power law:\n",

    "The advanced method demonstrated here expand upon the capabilities of the REE Costing Framework. Syntax for the example WaterTAP and custom models may be applied to any imported WaterTAP or custom model, respectively, and it is recommended that additional unit operation specificaitions are placed prior to calling the `build_process_costs`. The NPV calculations must be set up when instantiating the flowsheet costing block itself, as shown in this notebook, while the costing bounding equations are entirely independent of the capital and operating cost equations and may be added at any point while building the flowsheet."
