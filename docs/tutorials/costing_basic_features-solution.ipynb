    "# Basic Costing Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce the basic features and usage of the REE Costing Framework in PrOMMiS. This tutorial assumes that users are familiar with basic knowledge of building models in [Pyomo](https://pyomo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), [IDAES](https://idaes-pse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [PrOMMiS](https://prommis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates key features of the REE Costing Framework in PrOMMiS that enable users to add costing to their PrOMMiS flowsheets. The costing leverages the [Quality Guidelines for Energy Systems Studies (QGESS) methodology](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1567736) with many costing assumptions modified for critical minerals and rare earth element recovery systems as presented by the [University of Kentucky pilot study](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1569277). Users may refer to these references for further details on the costing methodology and assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The REE Costing Framework supports capital costs leveraging reference data, as well as installation, fixed operating and variable operating costs calculated based on plant inputs. The reference data lives in a [built-in cost account dictionary](https://github.com/prommis/prommis/blob/main/src/prommis/uky/costing/REE_costing_parameters.json) and follows a numbering convention set by QGESS standards for cost reference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capital cost calculations follow the general principle of economies of scale: as production increases, the cost per production of a particular unit operation decreases. As such, capital costs vary nonlinearly with capacity and are calculated via power law surrogate models in the costing framework. The cost of a single unit operation or cost account is denoted as the equipment cost, or the \"bare erected\" cost prior to installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installation costs are calculated as percentage factors of the total sum of Bare Erected Costs (BEC), which is the total capital equipment cost, in the plant, and fixed operating costs are largely taken as percentage factors of the total plant cost or total revenue. Variable operating costs reflect the overall usage of consumables, such as chemicals or electricity, or the required cost of waste disposal. Plant overhead and land/leasing costs are considered variable costs within the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial will take users through the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Importing the required tools from PrOMMiS and related repositories\n",
    "2. Adding capital costing for unit models using the cost account library\n",
    "3. Building process costs, including annualized capital and operating costs\n",
    "\n",

    "* REE Costing Module Code: https://github.com/prommis/prommis/blob/main/src/prommis/uky/costing/ree_plant_capcost.py\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstrative purposes, this tutorial will introduce costing in the context of the University of Kentucky flowsheet, shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![uky_flowsheet.png](./uky_flowsheet.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will show adding costing for the leach train, leach tanks, and process-related costs. For more information on specific unit models in PrOMMiS, please refer to the [UKy Flowsheet Tutorial](uky_flowsheet-solution.ipynb) which demonstrates the major unit models supported in PrOMMiS. A separate tutorial demonstrates a complete example of the [UKy Flowsheet with Costing](costing_uky_flowsheet-solution.ipynb)."

The framework is compatible with steady-state flowsheets (`dynamic=False`) and dynamic flowsheets (`dynamic=True`); however, not every supported unit model is compatible with a time index. If a time index does not exist on the main flowsheet and variable operating costs are built, a time index of `[0]` will be added to the flowsheet block.\n",

    "The costing block serves three purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `QGESSCosting()` method imports a ready-made dictionary of currency units from IDAES supporting cost years from 1990-2023. These cost-year factors are sourced from the public source [Towering Skills](https://www.toweringskills.com/financial-analysis/cost-indices/), and enable conversion of economic results between different reference years. Currency units may be treated as any other Pyomo UOM (units of measurement), and instantiating the `QGESSCosting()` class adds the currency conversions to the Pyomo UOM library. The REE Costing module appends custom year indices from public case studies that are not available in IDAES. For the purposes of this example, the default currency of `USD_2021` will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the `QGESSCosting()` method supports building cost equations with the IDAES `UnitModelCostingBlock()` method for each unit model block. The created costing block serves as a parent block for unit model costing, and the REE Costing Framework only needs to reference a single block to build process costing. For a usage example of IDAES costing, which utilizes unit model costing in a similar fashion, see the IDAES [Flowsheet Costing](https://github.com/IDAES/examples/blob/main/idaes_examples/notebooks/docs/flowsheets/hda_flowsheet_with_costing.ipynb) example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, the `QGESSCosting()` method contains all required capital and operating cost methods. After defining the unit model costing for each block in the flowsheet, a single `build_process_costs()` call builds all specified cost calculations. This will be discussed further in Step 3."

Costing may be attached to an imported, fully-defined unit model, or a dummy block such as Pyomo's `Block()` or IDAES's `UnitModelBlock()`. For this example, we will use the `LeachingTrain` model:"

    "The `UnitModelCostingBlock` requires a scaling parameter for the power law model; for the leach tanks, the capital cost scales with tank volume. Per the [University of Kentucky pilot cost account dictionary](https://github.com/prommis/prommis/blob/main/src/prommis/uky/costing/REE_costing_parameters.json), the leach tank `cost_accounts` name is \"4.2\". If multiple cost accounts support the same scaling parameter, the account names may be added to `cost_accounts` as a list and the final costing block will be indexed by that list.\n",

The argument `scale_down_parallel_equip` allows users to specify how trains of parallel units are treated. Setting this argument to `False` assumes that the scaling parameter is the capacity of each parallel unit, e.g. each leach tank in the train is identical and has a volume equal to `m.fs.leach.volume`. Setting this argument to `True` assumes that the scaling parameter is the total capacity for the entire train, e.g. each leach tank in the train is identical and the total volume of all tanks in the train is equal to `m.fs.leach.volume`. For a single unit, the assumptions lead to the same result. \n",

Users must set three arguments on the build method: resources, a list of strings corresponding to the variable cost names; rates, a list of model variables corresponding to the resource flows; and prices, an optional argument to add prices for new resources or overwrite existing prices. To use the default prices, the resource name must match the names in the default price dictionary. The rates do not need to have the same units as the default dictionary, but they do need to be compatible, e.g. if using the default cost for \"diesel\", the rate object may have any units of volume per time."
