    "# Diafiltration Flowsheet Optimization Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to set up, initialize, and optimize a process flowsheet using the PrOMMiS framework. We build on the example optimization script in a three-stage diafiltration process `src/prommis/uky/costing/diafiltration_flowsheet_optimization_example.py`.\n",

    "- Build and initialize the diafiltration flowsheet\n",
    "- Apply costing and constraints\n",
    "- Run baseline simulation (before optimization)\n",
    "- Perform optimization\n",

    "The script `diafiltration.py` defines the diafiltration flowsheet: it builds the model, initializes it, and solves for membrane lengths that satisfy product specifications. In this base flowsheet, the only active constraint is the product purity requirement. A detailed walk-through of the flowsheet configuration is provided in the [tutorial on lithium and cobalt separation via diafiltration](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/diafiltration-solution.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The script `src/prommis/uky/costing/diafiltration_flowsheet_optimization_example.py` extends this configuration by integrating the costing framework from PrOMMiS (using `QGESSCosting` in `ree_plant_capcost.py`). In later steps, this model will be extended with costing and optimization to determine stage lengths and operating parameters that minimize recovery cost while satisfying process constraints."
