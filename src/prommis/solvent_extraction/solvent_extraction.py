Solvent Extraction Model

========================

Author: Arkoprabho Dasgupta

The Solvent Extraction unit model is used to perform the solvent extraction unit operation.
It represents a series of tanks, referred to as stages, through which the aqueous and organic
phases are passed, and the desired components are extracted subsequently.

Configuration Arguments
-----------------------

The user must specify the following configurations in a solvent extraction model to be able to 
use it.

The user must specify the aqueous feed input in the ``aqueous_stream`` configuration, with a 
configuration that describes the aqueous feed's properties.

The user must specify the organic feed input in the ``organic_stream`` configuration, with a 
configuration that describes the organic feed's properties.

The number of stages in the solvent extraction process has to be specified by the user through 
the ``number_of_finite_elements`` configuration. It takes an integer value.

The material transfer can happen from either of the phases to the other. To specify the direction 
of the transfer, the ``aqueous_to_organic`` configuration is to be used by the user. This is a boolean 
configuration. The default value is True, which means the material transfer is happening from the 
aqueous phase to the organic phase, like in the loading operation. For scrubbing and stripping, the 
reverse happens, so the value of the configuration will be False.

Stream configurations
---------------------

Each of the feed streams has to have a dictionary that specifies the property packages and other 
details as mentioned below.

The ``property_package`` configuration is the property package that describes the state conditions 
and properties of a particular stream.

The ``property_package_args`` configuration is any specific set of arguments that has to be passed to 
the property block for the unit operation.

The user can specify the direction of the flow of the stream through the stages through the 
configuration ``flow_direction``. This is a configuration, that uses FlowDirection Enum, which
can have two possible values.

Degrees of freedom 
------------------

When the solvent extraction model is operated in steady state, the number of degrees of freedom of
the model is equal to the number of partition coefficients of the total components involved in the
mass transfer operation, for all the stages.

If the model is operated in dynamic state, the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the sum
of the partition coefficient of all components involved in the mass transfer operation, 
values of the state block variables of all the components of the system at the start of the
operation, the volumes and the volume fractions, for all the stages.

Model structure
---------------

The core model consists of a MSContactor model, with stream names hard coded as 'aqueous' and 
'organic', and the stream dictionaries and number of finite elements are the same as those provided
by the user.

This model defines the material transfer term defined in the MSContactor and expresses it as a
function of the parameter of partition coefficient defined by the user.
